## ALZAWARE (SCAN,SHIELD,SEEK) 

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Early detection and classification of its severity are crucial for effective intervention and management. 

In this project, we propose a machine learning framework utilizing the VGG16 for feature extraction and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for prediction and severity classification of AD. 

By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and robust classification algorithms, we aim to provide accurate predictions of Alzheimer's disease presence and its severity level, facilitating timely medical intervention and personalized patient care.
